## RVB Game

Throw three darts at 20-15. 

Score treble as 3, double as 2 and single as 1.

*Max score: 54*

## X01
Just like every other game of 301, 501, etc
Wanted the capability to increase it into the thousands.

## A1 Drill

Throw 3 darts at the segments 13 through 20 and Bull.
The object is to get at least 2 out of 3 darts in the bed.
When you hit a target, with at least 2 darts, you get a drill hit.
You need 5 drill hits on each target to close and finish the game.

## Switching Practice

Took the idea from Matador Darts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KapqZl4OPzo
Player throws first 2 darts at the 20 segment
Single number = 1 point, treble = 3.

Player then switches with the third dart
1x @ 19, 18, 17, 16, 15
Points on the switched segment are doubled (single/double = 2, treble = 6)

**If you miss the switch segment, you score *0 points* for you visit!**

Try to beat your previous score.

## Post-It Game

Attach post-it note to board. 

Throw 10 rounds at the note.

*Max score: 30*

## Checkpoint-501
Start at 501 and score as much as possible.
You need to reach any of the checkmarks to get points in this game.
For example:
- Reach 170 in 9 darts = 5 points
- Reach 125 in 12 darts = 4 points
- Reach 90 in 15 darts = 2 points
- Reach 40 in 18 darts = 1 point

## Power Scoring

Throw 10 rounds at 20-18 to practice cover shots.

Score treble as 3, double as 2 and single as 1.

*Max score: 90*


## Tidy

Based off of this practice routine: https://youtu.be/oTs8lqkqr_U

Get 3 darts in 20, move on to next until 17.

*Max score: 12*

## Random Double Practice

Generate number between 2-170

You have 6 darts to checkout, you have to complete before it regenerates a new number.

## Knockout Doubles

Throw first dart at Bull:

1. If you hit Bull, proceed to throw 2 darts at whichever double you'd like.

1. If you hit 25, proceed to throw 2 darts at the double that lines up with the dart.

1. If you hit a number, proceed to throw 2 darts at that number's double.

1. If you hit the double, it's been knocked out.

Continue until you've knocked out all of the doubles.

*Max score: 20 rounds*
